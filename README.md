# Verilog-Digital-System-Design
Verilog implementations

This project contains the Verilog HDL implementation and simulation
All designs were created and tested using **Xilinx Vivado** software. 
The purpose of this project is to understand the digital logic design concepts and verify them through waveform simulation.
